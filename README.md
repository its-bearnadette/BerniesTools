# BerniesTools
 A simple kit of tools for GMs and players of TRPGs.

Planned features, will definitely be present in the finished product:
- A simple to use but very flexible (optionally) physically simulated 3D dice roller.
- Pinnable "sticky" notes.
- Labeled progress clocks.
- Saving and loading session/campaign notes.
 - Hyperlinking, note tagging, searching tags.
 - Markdown and JSON, for easy migration.

Long-shot desires, things outside my ability or the current project scope:
- An integrated PDF reader. This is a bit beyond me at the moment.
- Spreadsheets & character keepers.
- Hexcrawl maker
- Networking to players, handling player notes and tools.
 - A collaborative drawing tool, like Drawpile.
 - Deck of playing cards.

I don't really plan to handle virtual tabletop stuff like maps and tokens. There are plenty of options out there that are mostly fine, and you can use them just fine. This program is made for a specific niche. You could probably do the same thing with Obsidian.
